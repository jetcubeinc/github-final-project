# Simple Interest Calculator

This is a basic Bash script that calculates simple interest given the principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

## Overview

A calculator that calculates simple interest using user-provided values. The script accepts three inputs: principal, rate, and time — then calculates and prints the simple interest.

## Formula

Simple Interest = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- **P** = Principal amount
- **R** = Annual rate of interest (in %)
- **T** = Time period in years

## Input

The script takes three inputs from the command line:
- `P` – Principal amount
- `R` – Annual rate of interest (in percentage)
- `T` – Time period in years

## Output

The script returns the calculated Simple Interest based on the given input.

## How to Run

You can run the script using the terminal:

```bash
bash simple-interest.sh <Principal> <Rate> <Time>
bash simple-interest.sh 1000 5 2
Simple Interest = 100.00
